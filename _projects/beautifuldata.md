With art museums making both their imagery and collections data open and accessible, a question arises: what to do with it all? In Beautiful Data,  a workshop supported by the Getty Foundation, participants made use of open collections to develop art-historical storytelling through data visualization, interactive media, enhanced curatorial description and exhibition practice, digital publication, and data-driven, object-oriented teaching.

The second annual offering of Beautiful Data (2015) focused on "difficult collections" poised on the edge of the digital/material divide, collections of things that resist ready digitization, or exist as ephemeral and hybrid objects and events.
